This project was started in an effort to help spread the word about Mainland Chinese musicians whose talents and songs don't reach Western audiences due to the lack of Youtube, Facebook and Twitter access that can contribute incredibly to sharing of popular tracks.<br><br>With that said, many artists from Taiwan and Hong Kong will be featured as well!<br><br>If you would like to encourage me to keep doing these videos/posts, please click the 'Like' button or subscribe when you're watching my videos. It REALLY makes my day when I see people enjoying my work and that it is not completely pointless.<br><br>Thank you so much for your support!
