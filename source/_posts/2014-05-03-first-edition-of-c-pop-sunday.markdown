</ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Zhang">Jane Zhang Liang Ying</a>'s Wo Shi Wo De or roughly translated to "I Am Mine" has a pretty cool video and catchy tunes that you can't miss this week! After she finished 3rd in a singing competition a few years ago, she has been releasing many singles and winning quite a few awards so it's not strange to see that her new track and video is currently in the top 10 videos in YinYueTai's VChart. Check it out!

<ul>
<li>Could not find any iTunes albums for Jane, but found some other <a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/4KNEctE2dk3QXwzjCBcZtw">Spotify tracks for her</a> including the amazing "I Believe".</li>
</ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jess_Lee_Kar_Wei">Jess Lee</a>'s Laugh To Tears. Jess Lee is a very talented Malaysian singer and winner of a singing competition in Taiwan where she's currently living. She has released a couple of interesting music videos after the competition, that despite containing some non-PG themes, definitely show that this girl can really sing.<ul><li>iTunes: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/hk/album/cliff-to-the-heaven/id849487621?i=849487697">https://itunes.apple.com/hk/album/cliff-to-the-heaven/id849487621?i=849487697</a></li></ul>

<li>Blast-From-The-Past Bonus Song: Seven Sense's Jade Smoke. Seven Sense is a fairly recently-formed group of professional dancers whose music has elements of traditional Chinese instruments and whose music videos include very classy and graceful dances with fans and traditional Chinese dance moves. All the seven members in the group are also very young but experienced in dance so there is definitely lots of potential and I seriously look forward to their future performances. For more information on the group's members, go to <a href="http://onehallyu.com/index.php?/topic/9410-the-official-seven-sense-%E4%B8%83%E6%9C%B5%E7%BB%84%E5%90%88-thread/">OneHallyu</a>. For today's blast from the past song, we have this song which was one of their first singles released last year. Enjoy! </li>
